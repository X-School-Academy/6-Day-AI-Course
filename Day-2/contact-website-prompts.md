**Prompt:**

Hi! My name is Frank He.  
I'm a former student of Baulkham Hills High School and currently a university student at UNSW.

Please design a personal portfolio website for me using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (no frameworks). The website should include the following:

### ðŸ“„ Sections:
1. **Introduction**  
   A short bio about me, including:
   - My name (Frank He)
   - My education background (Baulkham Hills High School and UNSW)
   - My interests (e.g., I enjoy coding)

2. **My Photo**  
   Add a placeholder for my profile picture.

3. **Social Links**  
   Include icons or links to the following:
   - GitHub: [https://github.com/frank-he-demo-only](https://github.com/frank-he-demo-only)  
   - LinkedIn: [https://linkedin.com/frank-he-demo-only](https://linkedin.com/frank-he-demo-only)  
   - YouTube: [https://youtube.com/frank-he-demo-only](https://youtube.com/frank-he-demo-only)

4. **Contact Form**  
   A simple form with the following fields:
   - Name
   - Email
   - Message

   The form doesnâ€™t need to actually send dataâ€”just design the front-end layout.

### ðŸŽ¨ Design Requirements:
- Clean, modern, and responsive layout
- Use pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only (no libraries or frameworks)
- Social icons can be simple text or placeholders
- Assume placeholder image and dummy text where needed
